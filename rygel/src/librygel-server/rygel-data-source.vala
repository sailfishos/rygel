/**
 * Interface for all data streams provided by a #RygelMediaEngine.
 *
 * When Rygel receives a HTTP request to stream a given file, it creates a
 * RygelDataSource object for this new file and instructs the RygelDataSource
 * to begin streaming. The RygelDataSource object will duly pass this request
 * on to the underlying media framework, which will in turn pass streamed bytes
 * back to the RygelDataSource object. The RygelDataSource passes these bytes
 * to Rygel which adds them to the response it sends to the original HTTP
 * request received from the client.
 *
 * The data source is responsible for providing response header information
 * describing the content being produced and a streamable byte-stream
 * via its data_available signal. End-of-stream is signalled by the 
 * done signal, while errors are signalled by the error signal.
 *
 * Implementations should fulfil at least these requirements:
 *
 *  # It should support at least the file:/''''/ URI scheme.
 *  # It should be able to stream any kind of binary data, regardless of the format.
 *
 * RygelDataSource instances are provided by
 * rygel_media_engine_create_data_source() which will return a derived #RygelDataSource
 * that uses a specific IO backend and/or multimedia backend to stream the
 * multimedia data at the URI.
 *
 * The derived RygelDataSource may provide additional API for use by
 * the derived media engine. For instance, rygel_media_engine_get_transcoders()
 * may return derived #RygelTranscoder instances, and these may use that
 * additional API in their create_source() implementations, for instance
 * to access resources or data structures of the specific multimedia backend.
