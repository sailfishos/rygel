/**
 * This is the base class for media engines that contain knowledge about 
 * the streaming and transformational capabilites of the media library in use.
 *
 * Media engines express what representations of a MediaObject they can
 * produce by returning MediaResource objects which will, in turn, be
 * used to express to endpoints representations can be streamed from
 * the MediaServer. These representations may include transformations,
 * time-scaled representations, and/or encrypted representations.
 *
 * See, for instance, Rygel's built-in "gstreamer" and "simple" media engines,
 * or the external rygel-gst-0-10-media-engine module.
 *
 * The actual media engine used by Rygel at runtime is specified
 * by the media-engine configuration key.
 * For instance, in rygel.conf:
 * media-engine=librygel-media-engine-gst.so
 *
 * Media engines should also derive their own #RygelDataSource,
 * returning an instance of it from create_data_source().
 *
 * See the
 * <link linkend="implementing-media-engines">Implementing Media Engines</link> section.
